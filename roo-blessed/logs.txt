Since the user hasn't specified what they want to work on, I should ask them what specific task they'd like to accomplish. I can provide some suggestions based on what I see in the codebase.

I can see you have a comprehensive Rust Bitcoin project called "deezel" with wallet functionality, transaction handling, Alkanes token system, and Runestone protocol integration.

2025-07-07T22:46:37.346Z [INFO] Roo: The user wants to start a task but hasn't specified what task they want to work on. Looking at the environment details, I can see this is a Rust project called "deezel" that appears to be related to Bitcoin, with components for:

1. Wallet functionality using BDK
2. Block monitoring and transaction tracking
3. Transaction construction and signing
4. RPC client implementation
5. Alkanes (some kind of token/contract system)
6. Runestone protocol integration

The project has a complex structure with multiple crates and extensive testing. There are also memory bank files that contain project context and progress tracking.
